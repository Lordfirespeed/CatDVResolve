## Upload to PyPI

### Using GitHub Actions (Automatic)
- Push changes to target branch and bump version number appropriately 
- (One-Time) Set up API key secret
  - Github repo -> "Settings" -> "Secrets" -> "Actions" -> "New repository secret"
  - Key should be `PYPI_API_TOKEN`, value should be token generated by PyPI with maintainer access to the package
- On the GitHub repository, navigate to "Actions"
- Select "Upload Python Package" workflow on the sidebar
- Select "Run Workflow", select the target branch, and press the green "Run workflow" button

### Using Twine (Manual)
- Clone the repository 
- Make a clean virtual environment `python -m venv ./venv`
- Activate the environment
- Install build dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Create some package distributions
  - `cd catdv_resolve`
  - `python -m build`
- (Optional) [Authenticate Twine with an API key](https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken)\
  You will need to enter your username/password each time you upload a distribution if you skip this step.
- Upload to PyPI `twine upload dist/*`
